                <p>Meet the angriest gamer on the planet. The concept of AVGN consists primarily of Rolfe depicting a vulgar, capricious character who is obsessed
                    with video games to the extent where he is named “the Nerd”. He reviews old-school video games and criticizes
                    their low quality, unattainably high levels of difficulty, and feeble aesthetics. Profanity plays a considerable
                    part in the Nerd conveying his strong opinions on the technicalities and issues with said video games,
                    thereby warning people against playing them as a result. The Nerd backs up his viewpoints with facts
                    on occasion, and also provides brief histories. The role presented by Rolfe is ludicrously archetypical;
                    he is a nerd filming in his basement with his distinctive eyeglasses, collared shirt accessorized with
                    a pen-protector, and high-waisted khaki trousers. The Nerd also features guests on the show from time
                    to time that parodically deride him and provide additional commentary on the video games. The Nerd
                    responds to this using comic appeal from excessive and surrealistic use of fantasy scenarios and anger
                    whilst reviewing the video games. To further exhibit his
                    anger and animosity, the character goes as far as burning and even completely destroying the game cartridges
                    and consoles. The Nerd, on occasion, also dresses up as certain characters whilst reviewing their games,
                    further making him more intriguing and unique.

                <!-- <p>Meet the angriest gamer on the planet. The Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN for short) is a fictional alcoholic
                    gamer who drives himself up the wall playing shitty video games from the past. He was created by James
                    Rolfe, an independent filmmaker who inspired countless other Youtubers to make their own videos and gave
                    birth to the angry video review genre</p> -->
